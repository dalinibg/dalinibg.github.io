      <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is <span style="color: grey;">Dalini Bilau Goncalves</span>, I am from Brazil, I am 24 years old and I have been living in the United States for two years. I have lived my entire life in one city until I decided to move to another country for a better life. The challenges that I went through, helped me to prepare for the life I am living right now, made me learn that self-growth is always welcome. </p>
      <p>I learned that graduating with an Associate Degree in Software Development 
      would help not just in my career, but also in my personal growth. For this reason, my desire 
      to learn how to code has just grown up with time. I am excited about the opportunities and challenges that this new path can give to me. </p>
