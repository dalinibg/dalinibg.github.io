    <p>I am from Brazil and I moved to the United States with the decision to have a better life. I learned that the option of graduating with an <b>Associate Degree in Software Development</b> would help not just in my career, but also in other aspects of my life. For this reason, my desire to learn how to code has just grown up with time.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Experience</h2>
    <p>Studying with a presential class with a professor and a class to learn together made me very excited to learn it, since I am great with teamwork.<i> I am a person who has been always very open to learning and I am very curious about everything, lately</i>, I have focused on how to make my problem-solving skills better. I am so grateful for the opportunity that I had studying in the United States and especially at The College of Western Idaho. The job opportunities after I graduate also make me excited. I am ready to take a new step in my professional life and to give my best in my future job.</p>
